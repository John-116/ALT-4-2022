# ALT-4-2022

These are St. Joseph's Patrician College Galway's 5th Year ALT4 Projects.
These projects were intended for microbits (Some projects may have components meant to run on a PC)


## Projects
The projects in this repository are as follows
- [An API based Bus Timetable](https://github.com/John-116/ALT-4-2022/tree/main/Bus%20Timer%20by%20John%20Denny%20and%20Maksym%20Luhin) by Myself and Maxysm Luhin. This uses an API to calculate when the next bus would arrive and send the data via Serial to a microbit.
- [A Door Alarm](https://github.com/John-116/ALT-4-2022/tree/main/Alarm%20by%20Damien%20Flanagan%20and%20Vishrut%20Srinivasa) by Damien Flanagan and Vishrut Srinivasa. This uses the magnetometer on the microbit and a magnet to detect when a door is opened.
- [A Telegram](https://github.com/John-116/ALT-4-2022/tree/main/Telegram%20by%20David%20Schirliu%20and%20Conor%20Jordan) by Conor Jordan and David Schirliu. This allows the user to communicate wirelessly via morse code.
- [A Traffic Sensor](https://github.com/John-116/ALT-4-2022/tree/main/Traffic%20Sensor%20by%20Daniel%20Percy%20and%20Danzel%20Guarda) by Daniel Percy and Danzel Guarda. This uses an PIR sensor to detect when a car has passed in hopes of getting our road a crossing.
